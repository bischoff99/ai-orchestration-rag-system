integration_status: partial

gemini_api:
  health_check: failed
  reason: Missing API key. The Gemini API requires an API key for authentication, but it was not provided.

chromadb:
  status: failed
  reason: Unable to initialize the ChromaDB collection. Multiple attempts to create the collection using different methods (library, direct API calls) failed with 404 and configuration errors. This prevented the successful execution of RAG queries.

rag_orchestrator:
  status: completed
  description: The RAG orchestrator has been updated to include Gemini as a secondary inference path. The code now supports routing 50% of the inference requests to Gemini, with the other 50% going to the local Ollama model. The selection is done randomly.

parallel_throughput:
  status: partial
  description: The parallel throughput test has been implemented in the RAG orchestrator. However, the results are not fully accurate due to the ChromaDB and Gemini API key issues. The test currently runs 100 concurrent queries, but the Gemini path is failing due to the missing API key, and the ChromaDB queries are failing due to the collection initialization issue.

next_steps:
  - Provide the Gemini API key to enable the Gemini inference path.
  - Resolve the ChromaDB initialization issue to enable the RAG queries to be executed successfully.
  - Re-run the parallel throughput test to get accurate benchmark results.
