# Practical Tasks for Project Development

This document outlines the next steps for the development of the project. The tasks are divided into three phases: stabilization, completion of Gemini integration, and enhancement of the RAG pipeline.

## Phase 1: Stabilize the Core Infrastructure

1.  **Resolve the ChromaDB Issue (High Priority):** The immediate priority is to get ChromaDB working. Without a functioning vector store, the RAG pipeline is broken. Here are some suggestions:
    *   **Consult the ChromaDB Documentation:** The official ChromaDB documentation might have information about the specific error you are encountering.
    *   **Seek Help from the Community:** The ChromaDB community (e.g., on Discord or GitHub) might be able to provide assistance.
    *   **Try a Different Environment:** There might be an incompatibility with your current OS or other libraries. You could try running the project in a different environment, such as a virtual machine or a different computer.

2.  **Configure the Gemini API Key:**
    *   Obtain the Gemini API key and configure it as an environment variable. This is essential for testing the Gemini integration.

## Phase 2: Complete and Validate the Gemini Integration

1.  **Re-run the Health Check:** Once the API key is in place, re-run the Gemini API health check to ensure connectivity.

2.  **Create and Run the Benchmark Script:** Create the `benchmark_gemini_vs_ollama.py` script and run it to get a baseline performance comparison between Gemini and Ollama.

3.  **Run the Full RAG Pipeline:** With ChromaDB and the Gemini API key working, run the full RAG pipeline with the 50/50 split and analyze the results.

## Phase 3: Enhance and Productionize the System

1.  **Implement Intelligent Routing:** Enhance the RAG orchestrator to use a more sophisticated routing strategy than the current random split. This could be based on factors like query complexity, cost, and latency.

2.  **Improve Error Handling and Caching:** Improve the error handling in the RAG orchestrator and implement a caching mechanism to improve performance and reduce costs.

3.  **Deployment:** Prepare the system for production deployment, including containerizing all the components and creating deployment scripts.
