# Benchmark Results: Gemini vs. Ollama

This document summarizes the results of the parallel benchmark test between the Gemini API and the local Ollama model. The test was executed by running 100 concurrent RAG queries, with the requests being randomly distributed between the two models.

## Analysis

The benchmark test was executed, but the results are not fully accurate due to the following issues:

1.  **Gemini API Key Not Configured**: The Gemini API key was not provided, which caused all requests to the Gemini API to fail. However, the orchestrator was modified to raise an exception in this case, which should have been reflected in the failure rate.

2.  **ChromaDB Collection Not Initialized**: The ChromaDB collection `rag_documents_collection` could not be created, which caused all RAG queries to fail at the context retrieval step. This should have resulted in a 100% failure rate.

3. **Contradictory Results**: The test reported a 0% failure rate, which contradicts the expected failures from the two issues mentioned above. This indicates a flaw in the error handling and reporting logic of the RAG orchestrator.

## Conclusion

The current benchmark results are not reliable. The RAG orchestrator needs to be fixed to correctly handle and report errors. Once the error handling is fixed and the Gemini API key and ChromaDB issues are resolved, the benchmark test should be re-run to obtain accurate results.
