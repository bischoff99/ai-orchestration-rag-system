Machine Learning Basics

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning:
   - Uses labeled training data
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM

2. Unsupervised Learning:
   - Works with unlabeled data
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
   - Algorithms: K-Means, PCA, DBSCAN

3. Reinforcement Learning:
   - Learns through interaction with environment
   - Examples: Game playing, Robotics
   - Algorithms: Q-Learning, Policy Gradient

Common ML Workflow:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Selection
4. Training and Validation
5. Model Evaluation
6. Deployment and Monitoring

Popular Python Libraries:
- Scikit-learn: General purpose ML
- TensorFlow: Deep learning framework
- PyTorch: Deep learning with dynamic graphs
- Pandas: Data manipulation
- NumPy: Numerical computing
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization

Evaluation Metrics:
- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Regression: MSE, RMSE, MAE, RÂ²
- Clustering: Silhouette Score, Inertia

Best Practices:
- Always split data into train/validation/test sets
- Use cross-validation for model selection
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Scale features when necessary
- Regularize to prevent overfitting
