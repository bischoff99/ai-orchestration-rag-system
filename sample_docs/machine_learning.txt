Machine Learning Basics

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning:
   - Uses labeled training data
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest

2. Unsupervised Learning:
   - Works with unlabeled data
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
   - Algorithms: K-Means, PCA

3. Reinforcement Learning:
   - Learns through interaction with environment
   - Examples: Game playing, Robotics

Popular Python Libraries:
- Scikit-learn: General purpose ML
- TensorFlow: Deep learning framework
- PyTorch: Deep learning with dynamic graphs
- Pandas: Data manipulation
- NumPy: Numerical computing

Evaluation Metrics:
- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Regression: MSE, RMSE, MAE, RÂ²
