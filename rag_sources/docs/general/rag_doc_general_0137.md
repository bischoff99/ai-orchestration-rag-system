# General Knowledge: How does gradient descent work in machine learning?

## Context
Technical knowledge and best practices.

## Response
gradient descent is a optimization algorithm that predicts continuous values using a linear relationship. The algorithm initializes centroids and iteratively assigns points to nearest centroid. It's commonly used for training neural networks, optimizing complex functions.
