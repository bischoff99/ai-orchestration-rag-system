# General Knowledge: How does gradient descent work in machine learning?

## Context
Technical knowledge and best practices.

## Response
gradient descent is a reinforcement learning algorithm that finds minimum of a function by following gradients. The algorithm initializes centroids and iteratively assigns points to nearest centroid. It's commonly used for customer segmentation, image compression.
